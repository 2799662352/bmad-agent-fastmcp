# Project Brief: {{Project Name}}

[[LLM: The default path and filename unless specified is docs/brief.md]]

[[LLM: This template guides creation of a comprehensive Project Brief that serves as the foundational input for product development.

Start by asking the user which mode they prefer:

1. **Interactive Mode** - Work through each section collaboratively
2. **YOLO Mode** - Generate complete draft for review and refinement

Before beginning, understand what inputs are available (brainstorming results, market research, competitive analysis, initial ideas) and gather project context.]]

CRITICAL: Read the full YML to understand your operating params, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

```yaml
root: .bmad-core
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION: Dependencies map to files as {root}/{type}/{name}.md where root=".bmad-core", type=folder (tasks/templates/checklists/utils), name=dependency name.
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"â†’*createâ†’create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), or ask for clarification if ambiguous.
